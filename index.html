                    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
                    <h3 id="problem-statement">Problem statement</h3>
                    <p>Convenient management of dataspaces for statistical Linked Data remains to be costly and lacks integrated and automated tool support. The design considerations and requirements are therefore at the forefront for reasonable functionality of these dataspace platforms.</p>

                    <p>Access to statistical data, primarily in the public sector has exploded in recent years. While these initiatives provide new opportunities to get insights on societies, management of the dataspaces are consequently confronted with new challenges. As centralized dataspaces are now faced with more heterogeneous data collections, with varying quality, solutions which employ the Linked Data principles appear to be promising.</p>

                    <p>However, due to a range of technical challenges, development teams often face low-level repetitive data management tasks with partial tooling at their disposal. These challenges on the surface include: addressing data integration, synchronisation, and access. Within the context of statistical data, the expectations from these dataspaces is that, a Linked Data tool-chain is utilized, and the data is accessible to both humans as well as the machines.</p>


                    <h3 id="hypothesis">Hypothesis</h3>
                    <p>It is contended that the deployment of statistical Linked Data comes with a specific set of requirements. The degree in which the requirements are accomplished predetermines the dataspace's usefulness for data consumers. Therefore, the hypothesis of this document is if a specific set of requirements for building and managing dataspaces for statistical Linked Data is possible, and the development of missing parts to do some of the processes better by reducing cost and making the dataspace more useful.</p>

                    <h3 id="contributions">Contributions</h3>
                    <p>With preference to minimizing developer intervention wherever possible, the contributions herein are within the expectations of working in Linked Dataspace and providing read access to data respectively. The set of design considerations and requirements are derived from case studies in publishing CSO Ireland, Eurostat, and World Bank datasets. The contributions will identify required components, missing tools, and highlight best practices to create a statistical Linked Dataspace:</p>

                    <h2 id="background">Background</h2>
                    <h3 id="dataspaces">Dataspaces</h3>
                    <p>The services that are typically offered in today's information managements systems have to deal with integration and administration of diverse data sources. An abstraction layer for the applications in these systems are considered as <q>Dataspaces</q> as proposed in <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1107502"><cite>From Databases to Dataspaces</cite></a> article. What constitutes a dataspace is that, it would typically consist of a set of data sources with some relationships between them.</p>

                    <dl>
                        <dt>Participants and Relationships</dt>
                        <dd>The participating data sources in a dataspace can be databases, repositories, web services or software packages. The source data can be structured, semi-structured or unstructured, where some may be set to allow updates, yet others only for reading. Similarly, a dataspace may have different relationship models between its sources, with descriptions at any level of granularity, as well as information on data provenance.</dt>

                        <dt>Catalog and Browse</dt>
                        <dd>Dataspaces may include services to allow different modes of interaction with the data sources. Systems might simply provide services to support access to its catalogue in order to allow users to browse its inventory of data resources. Catalogues may have metadata about the resources such as their original source, used schemas, statistics on the data, creators, various timestamps, licensing, completeness and so forth. This type of provenance data provides a perspective for the users and administrators about the elements in the data sources, as well as assistance in reproduction and quality analysis.</dd>

                        <dt>Search and Query</dt>
                        <dd>One other type of service is meant for discovering data by way of searching and querying. The primary function for these services is to allow users to locate and extract particular information from the data sources. A search service offers relevant results to users based on keyword searches, as well as further exploration of the results. Its purpose is to provide a mechanism to deal with large collections of unfamiliar data using natural languages that users are familiar with. A query service in contrast, is meant to provide a structured way to retrieve or manipulate information in participating data sources. One important differentiating factor between searching and querying is that, a query service can let users formulate far more complex questions about the data and get answers to them.</dd>

                        <dt>Local storage and index</dt>
                        <dd>In order to give the data sources a home and to allow inquiry services, a storage and an accompanying index component is used. Local storages and indexes aid in creating efficient queries, precise access to data, and support for data recovery and availability. Indexes are invaluable in terms of identify information across data sources whether locally or references to objects in the real-world.</dd>

                        <dt>Discovery and extensions</dt>
                        <dd>Another type of dataspace service is the discovery component which is used for relating dataspace participants and consequently allow the system to provide better query results. This component would discover, identify and classify data sources and their content in order to easily locate and refer to items in the dataspace in the future. It is important for this component to monitor and allow an environment to update the schema mappings over time in order to accurately represent the dataspace's assets.<dd>

                        <dt>Pay-as-you-go</dt>
                        <dd>The involvement of users and administrators in dataspaces is usually focused on taking care of most beneficial efforts first in creating semantic relationships. Hence, a pay-as-you-go approach to data integration is employed in dataspaces as complete upfront semantic integration is considered to be difficult and is not a required goal.</dd>
                    </dl>


                    <h3>Linked Data</h3>
                    <p>One manifestation of the Semantic Web vision is Linked Data. It is the a pragmatic approach to publishing structured data on the Web in order to discover related data from different sources. The original design principles was put forward by <a about="http://csarven.ca/#i" rel="foaf:knows" href="http://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/card#i">Sir Tim Berners-Lee</a> in 2006 as follows:</p>

                    <blockquote href="http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData.html">
                        <ol>
                            <li>Use URIs as names for things</li>
                            <li>Use HTTP URIs so that people can look up those names.</li>
                            <li>When someone looks up a URI, provide useful information, using the standards (RDF*, SPARQL)</li>
                            <li>Include links to other URIs. so that they can discover more things.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </blockquote>

                    <dl>
                        <dt>HTTP URIs</dt>
                        <dd>In a nutshell, the use of URIs allows us to refer to things and concepts, whether they are real or imaginary, in an absolute way. In order to persistently make use of things, <cite>Sir Tim Berners-Lee</cite> proposed that <q href="http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Axioms.html#Universality2">any resource of significance should be given a URI</q>. By employing the widely adopted <code>http:</code> URI scheme, the idea for Linked Data sets off in terms of providing a representation for requested resources.</dd>

                        <dt>RDF data model</dd>
                        <dd>The key ingredient in the information that is returned to the user has to do with the model of the data in the response. Regardless of the syntax that is used, Resource Description Framework (RDF) is essentially an entity-relationship model that provides a way to make statements about the things in our reality. A statement contains three atomic parts, also known as a triple: the <em>subject</em> resource in which the statement is about, followed with a <em>property</em> which is a vocabulary term that describes the type of relationship it has to an <em>object</em> resource. Each of these components are typically represented using HTTP URIs, with the possibility of the object resource being a literal string. In mathematical terms, RDF is a directed, labeled graph, which conceptually depicts a graph of things. What makes this method to make claims about things worthwhile is the act of linking any two URIs together in a particular way. It fundamentally presents an opportunity to discover new resources in an uniform way, whether the resource is in local storage or somewhere else.</dd>

                        <dt>RDF vocabularies</dt>
                        <dd>In RDF triple statements, properties are vocabulary terms that are used to relate a subject to an object. As these resources are accessible via HTTP URIs, when dereferenced they provide a description for the term in use. Some of the well-known vocabularies that are used in Linked Data publishing include: Friend of a Friend (FOAF) to describe people and the things that they do; RDF Data Cube which is used to describe multi-dimensional statistical data; SDMX for the statistical information model; British reference periods, SKOS to describe controlled thesauri, classification schemes and taxonomies; DC Terms for general purpose metadata relations and; VoID to provide metadata on datasets.</dd>

                        <dt>SPARQL</dt>
                        <dd>SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language (SPARQL) is a protocol and a query language to retrieve and manipulate RDF data. It can be used to express queries across local and remote data sources, whether the data resides in RDF files or databases. SPARQL queries consist of RDF triple graph patterns written in a fashion similar to Turtle, and allows modifiers for the patterns. In the Linked Data scene, it is common to see publicly accessible SPARQL endpoints where queries are sent and received over HTTP. Federated queries can be written to compute results that span over different SPARQL endpoints on the Web.</dd>
                    </dl>

                    <p>The Linked Data efforts are concerned with publishing and querying all sorts of data that's interconnected in the form of a <em>Giant Global Graph</em>. Some of the motivations behind this is to uncover insights about societies, build smarter systems, making predictions, democratizing data for people, or to make better decisions.</p>


                    <h3 id="linked-statistics">Linked Statistics</h3>
                    <p>With the rise of special-purpose, domain-specific formats such as <a href="http://www.scb.se/Pages/List____314011.aspx">PC-Axis</a> [<a href="#r_1">1</a>] or <a href="http://sdmx.org/">Statistical Data and Metadata eXchange</a> (SDMX) [<a href="#r_2">2</a>], an ISO standard for exchanging and sharing statistical data and metadata among organizations, re-using statistical data has become more possible. However, with the complexity introduced by these formats, the barrier for consuming the data has raised as well. On the other hand, general-purpose formats such as Microsoft's Excel or CSV are very widely deployed and a number of tools and libraries in any kind of programming language one could possibly think of exist to process them. The down-side of these formats is equally obvious: as much of the high-quality annotations and metadata, that is, how to interpret the observations, is not or only partially captured, the data fidelity suffers. Even worse, using these formats, the data and metadata typically gets separated. With linked statistics, one can leverage the existing infrastructure as well as retaining metadata along with the data, yielding high data fidelity, consumable in a standardised, straight-forward way. However, the handling of statistical data as Linked Data requires particular attention in order to maintain its integrity and fidelity.</p>

					<p>Going beyond the operations of slicing, filtering and visualising statistical data typically requires out-of-band information to combine it with other kinds of data. Contextual information is usually not found in the statistical data itself. Using linked statistics, we are able to perform this data integration task in a more straight-forward way by leveraging the contextual information provided by the typed links between the data items of one data set to other datasets in the LOD cloud.</p>

                    <p>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-data-cube/">RDF Data Cube vocabulary</a> is used to express multi-dimensional statistical data on the Web, and its data model is compatible with the cube model that underlies SDMX. Data cubes are in the nature of a hyper-cube such that multiple dimensions may be used to refer to a particular observation in the cube. Data cubes are characterised by their <em>dimensions</em>, which indicate what the observation is about with a set of properties; its <em>measures</em> to represent the phenomenon that is being observed with a value; and optionally with <em>attributes</em> which help interpret the measure values with a unit. Dimensions typically represent concepts, which are taken from a code list, and are highly valuable as they may used across data cubes by any consumer. Code lists, also known as classifications, are typically identified by using the <em>Simple Knowledge Organization System</em> (SKOS) vocabulary in RDF.</p>

					<p>What linked statistics provide, and in fact enable, are queries across datasets: given the dimensions are linked, one can learn from a certain observation's dimension value, other provided dimension values, enabling the automation of cross-dataset queries, hence cutting down integration costs and delivering results quicker.</p>

					<p>Organisations that are involved in publishing statistical Linked Data and establishing related methodologies and best practices include the <a href="http://data.gov.uk/">UK Government</a> [<a href="#r_3">3</a>], the National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies (<dfn><abbr title="National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies">INSEE</abbr></dfn>, France), the U.S. Bureau of Labour Statistics (<dfn><abbr title="Bureau of Labour Statistics">BLS</abbr></dfn>), and the European Environment Agency (<dfn><abbr title="European Environment Agency">EEA</abbr></dfn>). Statistics from many other sources are currently published not by the original statistics producer, but by third parties (universities, web technology companies etc.): U.S. Census 2000, Spanish Census, including historical microdata, EU election results, <a href="http://img.org/">International Monetary Fund</a> (<dfn><abbr title="International Monetary Fund">IMF</abbr></dfn>) commodity prices to name a few as well as the data from Central Statistics Office Ireland, Eurostat, and World Bank, which we will focus on in this paper.</p>

                    <h2 id="statistical-linked-dataspace">Statistical Linked Dataspace</h2>
                    <p>The idea of <em>Dataspaces</em> as discussed earlier was proposed without being tied to any particular set of technologies or types of data. It is a broad understanding of what constitutes a dataspace. For the moment, without diving into specific technologies, tooling, or data, first possible parallels needs to be drawn between the <em>Dataspaces</em> components and dataspaces which follows the Linked Data design principles. Table [<a href="#table_dataspaces-to-linked-dataspaces">1</a>] presents a generalized view for Linked Dataspaces.</p>

                    <table id="table_dataspaces-to-linked-dataspaces">
                        <caption><strong>Table 1.</strong> Dataspaces to Linked Dataspaces</caption>
                        <thead>
                            <tr><th>Dataspaces</th><th>Linked Dataspaces</th></tr>
                        </thead>

                    <p>As Dataspaces are not attached to any specific list of data deployment services or practices, the Linked Dataspace can be seen as a narrower or a particular realization of that. Having a dataspace that adheres to Linked Data principles is that, one of the forefront goals is to offer the data sources and some of its services in such a way that the underlying data can be globally accessed and can linked to by external data sources and applications. </p>

                    <p>The proposal here is that, although a Linked Dataspace can be used for any data, it is ideal for publishing statistical data on the Web. A statistical Linked Dataspace needs to identify resources and provide access to their descriptions. Such resources are in the nature of code lists, data cube observations, datasets and structures. Some of the specific challenges includes still include: extraction of original data sources, transformations to RDF, and loading (ETL) to data storage services; create global identifiers for its resources in its data catalogs; use vocabularies which are designed for modeling statistical data; offer services to the outside world such that its participating data can browsed through; be discovered via searches and queries; and interlinked with other data sources.</p>
