                    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
                    <h3 id="problem-statement">Problem statement</h3>
                    <p>Convenient management of dataspaces for statistical Linked Data remains to be costly and lacks integrated and automated tool support. The design considerations and requirements are therefore at the forefront for reasonable functionality of these dataspace platforms.</p>

                    <p>Access to statistical data, primarily in the public sector has exploded in recent years. While these initiatives provide new opportunities to get insights on societies, management of the dataspaces are consequently confronted with new challenges. As centralized dataspaces are now faced with more heterogeneous data collections, with varying quality, solutions which employ the Linked Data principles appear to be promising.</p>

                    <p>However, due to a range of technical challenges, development teams often face low-level repetitive data management tasks with partial tooling at their disposal. These challenges on the surface include: addressing data integration, synchronisation, and access. Within the context of statistical data, the expectations from these dataspaces is that, a Linked Data tool-chain is utilized, and the data is accessible to both humans as well as the machines.</p>


                    <h3 id="hypothesis">Hypothesis</h3>
                    <p>It is contended that the deployment of statistical Linked Data comes with a specific set of requirements. The degree in which the requirements are accomplished predetermines the dataspace's usefulness for data consumers. Therefore, the hypothesis of this document is if a specific set of requirements for building and managing dataspaces for statistical Linked Data is possible, and the development of missing parts to do some of the processes better by reducing cost and making the dataspace more useful.</p>

                    <h3 id="contributions">Contributions</h3>
                    <p>With preference to minimizing developer intervention wherever possible, the contributions herein are within the expectations of working in Linked Dataspace and providing read access to data respectively. The set of design considerations and requirements are derived from case studies in publishing CSO Ireland, Eurostat, and World Bank datasets. The contributions will identify required components, missing tools, and highlight best practices to create a statistical Linked Dataspace:</p>

                    <h2 id="background">Background</h2>
                    <h3 id="dataspaces">Dataspaces</h3>
                    <p>The services that are typically offered in today's information managements systems have to deal with integration and administration of diverse data sources. An abstraction layer for the applications in these systems are considered as dataspaces. Thus, what constitutes a dataspace is that, it would typically consist of a set of data sources with some relationships between them.</p>

                    <p>The participating data sources in a dataspace can be databases, repositories, web services or software packages. The source data can be structured, semi-structured or unstructured, where some may be set to allow updates, yet others only for reading. Similarly, a dataspace may have different relationship models between its sources, with descriptions at any level of granularity, as well as information on data provenance.</p>

                    <p>Dataspaces may include services to allow different modes of interaction with the data sources. Systems might simply provide services to support access to its catalogue in order to allow users to browse its inventory of data resources. catalogues may have metadata about the resources such as their original source, used schemas, statistics on the data, creators, various types of timestamps, licensing, completeness and so forth. This type of provenance data provides a perspective for the users and administrators about the elements in the data sources, as well as assistance in reproduction and quality analysis.</p>

                    <p>One other type of service is meant for discovering data by way of searching and querying. The primary function for these services is to allow users to locate and extract particular information from the data sources. A search service offers relevant results to users based on keyword searches, as well as further exploration of the results. Its purpose is to provide a mechanism to deal with large collections of unfamiliar data using natural languages that users are familiar with. A query service in contrast, is meant to provide a structured way to retrieve or manipulate information in participating data sources. One important differentiating factor between searching and querying is that, a query service would typically allow the users to formulate and get answers to complex questions about the data.</p>

                    <p>In order to give the data sources a home and to allow inquiry services, a storage and an accompanying index component is used. Local storages and indexes aid in creating efficient queries, precise access to data, and support for data recovery and availability. Indexes are invaluable in terms of identify information across data sources whether locally or references to objects in the real-world.</p>

                    <p>Another type of dataspace service is the discovery component which is used for relating dataspace participants and consequently allow the system to provide better query results. This component would discover, identify and classify data sources and their content in order to easily locate and refer to items in the dataspace in the future. It is important for this component to monitor and allow an environment to update the schema mappings over time in order to accurately represent the dataspace's assets. Here, the involvement of users and administrators in dataspaces is usually focused on taking care of most beneficial efforts first in creating semantic relationships. Hence, a pay-as-you-go approach to data integration is employed in dataspaces as complete upfront semantic integration is considered to be difficult and is not a required goal.</p>
